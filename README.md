<p>I'm a University Student with specialized skills in Finacial Programming using COBOL, full-stack Andriod and iOS Project Management, Functional and Object-Oriented programming,  EC2 geographical planning for cloud computing, and finally I have an understanding of how data flows on the IBMZ mainframes. I'm currently attending UNF for my undergraduate degree in Finance. My first project I created in highschool was WTMNOW which launched in 2021 on both Andriod and iOS from which I managed a team of developers, with the help of Gajendra & Rajdeep. I was unable to manage it while transitioning to University and decided passed it off to another board member. I currently run a small business with my wife handling International shipping and to door delivery called USTOHOME.
